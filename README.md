# dotfiles
- Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.
- Everything's built around topic areas.
- **use at your own risk**

## Requirements
- execute `xcode-select --install` for macOS.
- install [font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts) for powerlevel10k.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/longf2021/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
p/bootstrap
```

## How it works
